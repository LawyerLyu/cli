// CommandView); Args is the actual user input; Started is when the
// outermost RunE wrapper began. Err is populated for After hooks and
// the post-next portion of a Wrapper.

// The struct is deliberately NOT a context.Context -- it is data only,
// no cancellation. ctx (from the function signature) is the
// context.Context for cancellation/timeout/trace propagation.

// Implementation note: the lazy fields (DeniedByPolicy, Identity, etc.)
// are populated by the framework before any hook fires. Plugins must
// not depend on these being non-zero at construction; they always read
// through the accessor methods which centralise the "is this populated
// yet?" logic.
